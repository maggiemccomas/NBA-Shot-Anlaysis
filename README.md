# NBA-Shot-Anlaysis
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing NBA player shot data using Python and the NBA API. Shot data for NBA players, such as Steph Curry and Dell Curry, is retrieved and analyzed to gain insights into their shot patterns and performance during specific seasons.

### Overview
The project involves fetching NBA shot data for selected players, processing the data, and creating visualizations to analyze their shot tendencies during specific NBA seasons. The analysis includes shot distribution on the court, makes vs. misses plot, and joint shot distribution plot, among others.

### Project Structure
The project is structured into different Python scripts, each focusing on specific aspects of the analysis, including data retrieval, processing, and visualization. Additionally, the integration with Tableau for creating enhanced visualizations is facilitated through data export.

### Data Retrieval and Processing
Shot data for NBA players is retrieved using the NBA API, and relevant information is processed to create insightful visualizations. The data is cleaned, mapped to quarters, and saved to be imported into Tableau.

### Data Visualization 
Various types of visualizations are created, including shot distribution plots on the basketball court, makes vs. misses plots, and joint shot distribution plots. These visualizations help in analyzing shot patterns and performance of the players.

### Integration with Tableau
In addition to Python-based visualizations, this project integrates with Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool. Tableau is used to create enhanced shot charts, shooting statistics, and dashboards for each player.
